<br />
There's a reason behind it and that's because our previous webhost company registered the site for us. That proved to be a mistake as they have some shady techniques and refused to transfer our domain to our account. So we will let that domain expire and be deleted or if we can get the funding, to get it back by filing a report.<br />
<br />
We're deeply sorry to those who in one way or another have been affected by this and have found their admin panels not working but this is something we did not expect when we first registered our domain. The good news is that this .com domain is fully under our control and safe so this will not happen again. We're here to stay!<br />
<br />
As I write this news we are also updating the mucore packages to connect with our server instead of the old one.<br />
<br />

Its' because of this, that from now on, every file that we share or you send to us, whether it's server files, clients, scripts, will be uploading to different hosts, it gets annoying that one day you try to get a file and it's no longer there because some delusional eagle thinks it's the world's police <img src='http://bizarre-networks.com/public/style_emoticons/default/dry.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='&lt;_&lt;' /> .]]>";s:4:"guid";s:70:"http://bizarre-networks.com/index.php/topic/335-redundance-is-the-key/";s:7:"pubDate";s:31:"Sun, 08 Apr 2012 04:43:22 +0000";}i:3;a:5:{s:5:"title";s:46:"We have a New domain, New look and a new Host!";s:4:"link";s:93:"http://bizarre-networks.com/index.php/topic/331-we-have-a-new-domain-new-look-and-a-new-host/";s:11:"description";s:1193:"<![CDATA[hey there <img src='http://bizarre-networks.com/public/style_emoticons/default/smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> we have been looking for ways to improve our service to everyone and thanks to a small donation we now have our new .com website hosted on a very fast vps provided by: <a href='https://vps6.net/my/aff.php?aff=102' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'><br />
