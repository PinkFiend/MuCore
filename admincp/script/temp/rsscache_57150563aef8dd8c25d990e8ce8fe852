<br />
Simply put, I always wanted to have my own gaming network, it started circa 2005 when i was a game modder for Red alert 2: Yuri's Revenge, and i became interested on modding other games aswell, at first i thought of naming it Bizarre Thought Studios.. wasn't my favourite, but i was getting there, then I thought of Bizarre Mind Studios, but it also didn't seem to fit or express what i wanted to do, "studios" I don't know, that sounded more like a centralized thing, like a big forum for games, so Bizarre Mind Networks was born, different games offered by us, each with a different website, but the whole community joined on a single forum, see the difference? o.o <br />
<br />
Why Bizarre Mind? I'm the kind of person who always has a million thought on her head, I go with one thing, then i go with the other, and so on. So, in a way, this is my little space in the internet.<br />
<br />
Stay tuned, as soon things will start to take shape <img src='http://bizarre-networks.net/public/style_emoticons/default/tongue.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' /></span>]]>";s:4:"guid";s:90:"http://bizarre-networks.net/index.php?/topic/17-welcome-everyone-to-bizarre-mind-networks/";s:7:"pubDate";s:31:"Tue, 19 Apr 2011 03:42:59 +0000";}}s:11:"items_count";i:2;}
